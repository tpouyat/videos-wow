corruption you-only: at 1/3, large circle, 2/3 small circles, 3/3 massive hps and then mind-control
	permanent, but now comes in dream state.
dream: lose all your corruption, and mana and cd's back, you don't get mind controlled

phase 1: 
blades will run through 2 players, need good position (a gap between melee and range is great)
be spread out to avoid dmg from add spawn
healer = DoT on tank needs extra attention:
	wait 3 stacks, move out of melee camp, dispel by dream healer.

phase 2:
move the boss into the middle of the room (to avoid adds reaching him)
when they die, they leave a pool which turns into an add - except for soaking it and taking corruption
bonds of terror kills you - except if you guys stay together.
corruption meteor => get every dream player in there to mitigate dmg and give corruption
	still really high damage so might need to hit everyone in small group
There's another debuff that needs dispelling but also spawns adds

phase 3:
no one in dream, he has phase 1 and 2 attacks.
ignore the tentacles.
KILL THE BOSS NOW!!!!!!!
