mark a player => debuff over 6 sec => charge --> half the raid stand in that so that you don't wipe
stand in melee in between charges to mitigate damage
the boss gains in dps, so keep your cd's til then. In heroic, avoid the goo 2 secs after the cocophony
tanks take more dmg because of debuffs: taunt when the other tank gets the debuff
