unavoidable damage from beam...
tentacles deals a lot of damage to the tank.
damge is dealt to the tentacles knockdown.
dispel the dots from the balls from the tentacles
mind flay deals a lot of damage
avoid the beam, heal the tank targeted by it (he's gonna take a lot of dmg)
dispel the dot and avoid the goo from it, spot heal these guys.
kill the scond beam guy.

kill off the eye, and then run inside but after finishing the eyes.
kill the tumor, people have some debuffs that'll explode - spot heal them (you can use revival here)

more tentacles - more attention to tank - BL is best here.
more eye beam, more, more, more...
then finish it off.
