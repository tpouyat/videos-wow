phase 1: the ADDS phase
tank the adds away from the boss to avoid killing the adds
those roots thingies are a pain, just move away from them and the raid
constant ticking dmg to the group - 20 stacks is noticeable - however you can remove it when that green stuff comes in (just pop in there, though)

first wave of adds => wisps to be cleansed (by having everyone there)
second wave => wisps again, those sisters will need dispelling attention (+ explosion)
third => cleanse the tree
fourth => cleanse the wisps

phase 2:
adds don't spawn - cleansed ground generally on melee
massive amount of damage on the tanks - so be careful
lots of goo - get out of it.
