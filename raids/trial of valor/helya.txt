debuffs on tank
adds => deal unavoidable damage
fixating orbs => kite it away, spot heal
dispel on tank instantly when right before breath and need for taunting
tentacle needs to be soaked

she disappears, loads of adds, loads of debuffs, follow dbm, organised movement.
1. some rDPS to go deal dmg to front tentacles, 2 big adds to be sent in the back
2. once they're dead, retreat to the left platform, cc the adds
3. another 2 big adds to be tanked at the front right, ignore the minions
4. do the same as 2. on the right platform

when fixated, hug the walls (it's fine to take dmg), spot heal required
you can even  go up and back down in a loop
soak the purple stuff
make sure to top up people for waves
don't ignore the adds
