phase 1: hyrja and hymdall
they need to reach 25% health at the same time
but you can't cleave them so you have split the group in 2
hyrja sends a beam, you need to be in it do split dmg (go into the middle of the room if targeted)
hymdall sends a circle in melee that'll kill you
runes => drag the add inside the rune.

phase 2: odyn
rune thing again
stacking debuff on tank
don't be hit by orbs or you'll be stunned
unavoidable dmg from shattering spears

phase 3: odyn 55%
move out of the light
debuffs that explode and give tornado - up against the wall
tanks: when you get debuffed, move away from the boss but you'll take massive dmg so spot heal
constant ticking raid dmg - it's like the enrage of the fight.
